# Closed Source vs. Open Source vs. Open Weight Models: A Comparative Analysis of Definitions, Licensing, Security, and Auditability in Enterprise AI

## Section 1 — Research Scope & Methodology

### 1.1 Primary Research Question
How do closed source, open source, and open weight models compare across system definitions, licensing paradigms, security implications, and auditability in enterprise deployments?

### 1.2 Scope
This research report covers the global enterprise AI deployment landscape, focusing on architectural and legal models active in 2026. The scope includes closed-source models accessed via cloud APIs, true open-source models with released training datasets, and open-weight models with downloadable parameters but restricted licenses. The target audience includes enterprise CTOs, chief legal officers (CLOs), risk managers, and system integrators. The geographical scope encompasses global regulations, paying special attention to US and EU legal systems governing software licensing, intellectual property rights, and consumer data protection.

### 1.3 Methodology
Research was conducted using the Web Research Skill v1.0: web search discovery followed by full-content retrieval and source verification. Primary documentation, including vendor terms of service, license agreements (such as the Apache 2.0 license, Meta Llama 3/3.2 Community License, and Google Gemma Terms of Use), and academic analyses of model open-access definitions, were evaluated. The research compiles technical definitions, legal permissions, security models, and auditability standards to build a comparative taxonomy. The analysis includes evaluating licensing terms for commercial thresholds, redistribution rights, downstream derivative model constraints, and intellectual property warranties.

### 1.4 Limitations
Key constraints include the lack of legal precedents regarding the enforcement of custom open-weight licenses, the proprietary nature of closed-source model training datasets, and the difficulty of verifying data provenance for open-weight models. The study excludes academic research models that lack commercial support or active enterprise interest, focusing exclusively on commercially viable models.

## Section 2 — Executive Summary

The rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into enterprise operations has created a complex choices matrix for technology leaders. This report provides a rigorous comparative analysis of the three primary model deployment paradigms: Closed Source (proprietary), Open Source (strictly defined), and Open Weight. While the market frequently collapses these terms into a simple binary of "open" versus "closed," their differences in licensing permissions, security boundaries, and auditability are profound, directly affecting corporate liability, data governance, and long-term operating costs.

We identify four critical areas of divergence. First, closed-source models (such as OpenAI's GPT-4, Anthropic's Claude, and Google's Gemini API) are hosted entirely on vendor infrastructure, providing zero access to model weights and restricted data auditiability. Second, true open-source models (such as OLMo and Pythia) release their weights, training code, and training datasets under Open Source Initiative (OSI) approved licenses, such as Apache 2.0, providing complete transparency at the cost of raw capability. Third, open-weight models (such as Meta's Llama family, Google's Gemma, and Mistral models) allow local execution of weights but are governed by custom commercial licenses that impose usage caps, attribution requirements, and field-of-use restrictions. Fourth, security threat models shift from external vendor data-exposure risks in closed models to internal infrastructure and supply-chain vulnerabilities in open deployments.

Our key findings indicate that while open-weight models have democratized custom fine-tuning and local, network-isolated execution, they are frequently mislabeled as "open source." Meta's Llama license, for example, imposes a threshold requiring organizations with over 700 million active users to obtain a custom commercial license. Furthermore, open-weight models do not disclose their training datasets, leaving enterprises vulnerable to intellectual property litigation regarding training data provenance. In contrast, true open-source models allow complete auditability of the training pipeline but lag behind in reasoning capabilities.

The top recommendation of this report is for enterprise technology leaders to implement a tiered model selection framework. For high-stakes, data-sensitive applications requiring strict data residency (such as customer data processing or internal finance), organizations should deploy open-weight models on private, containerized cloud infrastructure. For general productivity, coding assistance, and complex reasoning, closed-source APIs should be utilized, provided they are bound by enterprise DPAs. Enterprises must mandate legal review of all open-weight licenses, ensuring compliance with user caps and redistribution clauses to mitigate compliance risks.

## Section 3 — Context & Background

The debate between proprietary and open systems is a recurring theme in the history of software development. In the early era of computing, software was routinely distributed with source code, allowing researchers to modify and share systems freely. With the commercialization of software in the 1970s and 1980s, proprietary licensing became the dominant economic model, prompting the creation of the Free Software Foundation and the Open Source Initiative (OSI) to protect software transparency (Stallman, 1985). This movement established licenses like the GNU General Public License (GPL) and the Apache 2.0 license, which guarantee users the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change, and improve software without commercial restriction.

The emergence of deep learning and generative AI has complicated this licensing framework. Unlike traditional software, where source code represents the complete execution logic, a neural network's behavior is defined by its architecture and its parameters (weights), which are learned during pretraining on billions of tokens of text. Thus, "source code" in the context of an LLM is insufficient; to study, modify, or run a model, developers require access to the trained weights. This led to a split in developer models. Closed-source vendors chose to hide weights, offering access only via cloud APIs to protect intellectual property and control usage.

In 2023, the release of Meta's LLaMA model initiated the open-access era, allowing researchers to download weights and run models on local hardware (Touvron et al., 2023). This release catalyzed a community ecosystem, but it also introduced a new legal category: the "open weight" license. Unlike OSI-approved open-source licenses, which prohibit discrimination against fields of endeavor or commercial scale, Meta's license restricted usage for very large platforms and prohibited using the model's outputs to train competing models. This created a split: true open-source models release weights, training code, and training datasets under permissive licenses, while open-weight models release weights under custom licenses that restrict commercial rights.

Understanding these distinctions is essential for modern enterprise governance. Technology leaders must evaluate these models not only on performance benchmarks but on legal alignment, security postures, and compliance audits. A clear understanding of the licensing differences between Apache 2.0 and custom community licenses is a basic requirement to avoid operational disruption or legal exposure (Gartner, 2025).

## Section 4 — Research Findings

### 4.1 Closed Source Models: Characteristics, Vendors, and Constraints
Closed-source models represent the proprietary paradigm of AI deployment. Deployed by vendors such as OpenAI (GPT-4/GPT-5), Anthropic (Claude), and Google (Gemini), these models are hosted on the vendors' cloud datacenters. The model weights, pretraining code, training dataset mixtures, and post-training safety parameters are kept strictly secret. Access is mediated exclusively through web APIs or managed cloud platforms. This architecture ensures that the vendor retains complete control over model versioning, execution runtime, and pricing structures.

For enterprise buyers, closed-source models offer the highest raw cognitive capability and reasoning performance on release day. Because training frontier models requires capital investments exceeding hundreds of millions of dollars, closed-source vendors can leverage massive compute clusters that are out of reach for individual enterprises. However, this model introduces significant constraints. The model is a black box: the customer cannot audit the weights, verify the training data for copyright compliance, or control model updates. Furthermore, pricing models are transaction-based, charging per input and output token, which can lead to high operating costs at scale. Rate limits, such as Tokens Per Minute (TPM) and Requests Per Minute (RPM), restrict throughput, and service outages can disrupt application availability. Customers must negotiate SLAs and rely on dedicated support tiers hosted on public cloud regions (such as Microsoft Azure for OpenAI, AWS for Claude, and Google Cloud for Gemini). Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud offer dedicated data isolation agreements, but raw weight extraction remains impossible.

### 4.2 Open Source Models (Strict Sense)
True open-source models are built to align with the Open Source Definition established by the Open Source Initiative (OSI). In this paradigm, the developer releases not only the final model weights (parameters) but also the complete pretraining code, dataset preprocessing scripts, hyperparameter configurations, and the exact training data mixtures utilized during training. These components are released under OSI-approved permissive licenses, most commonly the Apache 2.0 license or the MIT license. Notable examples include the Allen Institute for AI's OLMo model and EleutherAI's Pythia suite (Groeneveld et al., 2024).

The primary advantage of true open-source models is auditability. For example, EleutherAI's Pythia model was trained on the fully public "Pile" dataset, allowing developers to inspect the exact files and documents used to build the model's weights. Because the training dataset is public, an enterprise can verify that the model was not trained on copyrighted materials, private data, or biased sources. This level of transparency is critical for organizations operating in highly regulated fields, such as government, defense, and public audit services, where data provenance must be legally verifiable. However, because compiling and releasing massive, clean datasets is difficult due to privacy and licensing constraints, true open-source models are often smaller and lag behind closed-source and open-weight models in general reasoning capabilities.

### 4.3 Open Weight Models
Open-weight models represent a middle ground that has dominated the developer community. In this paradigm, vendors (such as Meta with Llama, Google with Gemma, Alibaba with Qwen, and Mistral AI) release the trained weights and inference code, allowing developers to download, self-host, and fine-tune the models locally. However, the pretraining datasets are kept secret, and the models are governed by custom community licenses that do not meet the OSI definition of open source.

These community licenses contain strict commercial limitations. For example, Meta's Llama 3 and Llama 3.1 Community License Agreements allow commercial distribution but require a custom license from Meta if the licensee's active monthly users exceed 700 million (Meta, 2024). Alibaba's Qwen model family imposes a similar commercial cap, requiring custom licensing for platforms exceeding 100 million active monthly users. Additionally, these licenses prohibit using model outputs to improve or train other models. Google's Gemma terms impose similar restrictions regarding downstream model development and compliance with safety guidelines. These restrictions mean that while open-weight models are highly accessible, they are legal contracts with compliance requirements. Enterprises must track model usage, distribution paths, and downstream applications to ensure compliance.

### 4.4 Enterprise Trade-offs in Security and Auditability
Security threat models differ fundamentally across these three paradigms. For closed-source models, the primary security risks are external: data exposure in transit, vendor security breaches, and model availability. Organizations must trust the vendor's infrastructure security and DPA terms. Auditability is restricted; the client cannot inspect the model for embedded biases, backdoors, or vulnerability to extraction attacks.

For open-source and open-weight models, the security control shifts to the enterprise. Because the weights are executed locally, the risk of data exposure to external vendors is eliminated. This allows organizations to host models inside secure, air-gapped networks. However, this creates new internal security requirements. The enterprise must secure the model execution runtime, protect the weight files from unauthorized modification, and scan downloaded model checkpoints for security risks. Because PyTorch weight files (using pickle serialization) can execute arbitrary code upon loading, organizations should mandate Safetensors formats to mitigate execution vulnerabilities (Hugging Face, 2025). Furthermore, downloading unverified weights exposes local networks to "trojan" or "backdoored" weights, where a model is trained to leak system secrets when triggered by specific prompt phrases. Additionally, the lack of dataset disclosure in open-weight models introduces legal risks, as the organization cannot audit the model's training data for intellectual property violations, potentially exposing the firm to copyright claims.

---

## Section 5 — Data & Evidence Summary

To guide strategic alignment, we compile a comparative summary of capabilities, legal rights, and security features across the three paradigm types (Gartner, 2025; Hugging Face, 2025; Meta, 2024; OpenAI, 2025).

| Attribute | Closed Source (API) | Open Source (Strict) | Open Weight (Llama/Gemma) | Source Organisation | Data Date | Tier | Verified |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Weights Downloadable | No | Yes | Yes | Analyst Compilation | 2026 | Tier 2 | Y |
| Pretraining Code Released| No | Yes | Yes (Inference only) | Analyst Compilation | 2026 | Tier 2 | Y |
| Pretraining Data Released| No | Yes | No | Analyst Compilation | 2026 | Tier 2 | Y |
| OSI-Approved License | No | Yes (Apache 2.0 / MIT) | No (Custom Community) | OSI Registry | 2025 | Tier 1 | Y |
| Commercial User Cap | N/A (Pay-per-token) | None | Yes (e.g., Llama 700M cap) | Meta / Google | 2024 | Tier 1 | Y |
| Local/Private Hosting | No | Yes | Yes | Analyst Compilation | 2026 | Tier 2 | Y |
| Data Provenance Audit | Impossible | Complete | Impossible | Analyst Compilation | 2026 | Tier 2 | Y |
| Safe Against Exec Exploits | Managed by Vendor | Risks in raw serialization | Risks in raw serialization | OWASP / Hugging Face | 2025 | Tier 1 | Y |

A significant data gap exists regarding the legal enforcement of "competing model" clauses in open-weight licenses. While Meta and Google prohibit using model outputs to train other models, it is technically challenging to prove that an open-weight model's synthetic data was used to train a downstream model. This lack of legal precedents means that the legal risk of synthetic dataset utilization remains an active area of uncertainty for enterprise compliance teams, who must exercise caution when designing pipeline dependencies.

## Section 6 — Analysis

To analyze the implications of these paradigms for enterprise operations, we apply a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analytical framework, comparing the deployment of Closed Source (API) versus Open Weight (Self-Hosted) models.

```

### Strengths
The strengths of Closed Source APIs lie in their performance, ease of use, and developer support. Organizations can access state-of-the-art models immediately without investing in high-end GPU hardware, minimizing capital expenditure. The strength of Open Weight models is operational sovereignty. Because the models run on local hardware, they provide absolute data privacy, making them highly suited for air-gapped deployments. Furthermore, organizations can perform deep, weight-level fine-tuning (using LoRA/QLoRA) to specialize the model for narrow corporate tasks, achieving high efficiency.

### Weaknesses
Closed Source weaknesses are centered on dependency and privacy risks. Enterprises are bound to the vendor's pricing, availability, and lifecycle decisions, and sensitive data must leave the corporate network for processing. Open Weight weaknesses are infrastructure and legal complexity. Self-hosting requires expensive GPU clusters (such as NVIDIA H100s or A100s) and specialized MLOps teams to manage deployment, containerization, and model versioning. Additionally, custom community licenses introduce audit requirements.

### Opportunities
Closed Source APIs present opportunities for rapid feature testing and integration with standardized software ecosystems. Open Weight models offer opportunities for local edge execution (e.g. running on local workstations or mobile devices) and compliance under strict regional data protection laws, enabling organizations to deploy AI without violating sovereign data limits, fostering rapid local application cycles.

### Threats
Closed Source deployments face threats from vendor pricing changes, API deprecation, and cloud outages. Open Weight models face threats from training data provenance lawsuits: because pretraining data is undisclosed, a third-party copyright claim against the base model could potentially affect enterprise applications built on those models. Furthermore, self-hosting introduces the risk of model weights theft or unauthorized modifications to local weight files by malicious insiders.

---

## Section 7 — Implications

### 7.1 Near-Term Implications (0–12 months)
In the near term, corporate legal departments will struggle to establish standardized templates for reviewing open-weight licenses. Procurement cycles for models like Llama or Gemma will be delayed as attorneys evaluate user caps and redistribution terms. Simultaneously, organizations will invest in local hardware clusters or cloud-dedicated GPU nodes to build pilot hosting environments, leading to a rise in capital expenditures. Security teams will establish scanning policies for downloaded checkpoints, forcing developers to convert PyTorch serialization files to Safetensors format before execution to prevent malware vectors.

### 7.2 Medium-Term Implications (1–3 years)
Over the next one to three years, the distinction between open-weight and closed-source models will drive the emergence of specialized hybrid architectures. Enterprises will use closed-source APIs for initial prototype design and broad reasoning tasks, and transition to fine-tuned, self-hosted open-weight models for high-volume production operations to lower operational costs. Legal frameworks for model auditing will mature, and independent consortiums will establish certifications for training data provenance, helping open-weight vendors address copyright concerns.

### 7.3 Long-Term Implications (3+ years)
In the long term, true open-source models (with fully public training data and code) will achieve parity with commercial offerings, driven by academic and public interest funding. This will reduce enterprise legal risk and eliminate compliance concerns associated with proprietary or open-weight community licenses. For high-security environments (such as intelligence agencies and defense contractors), local, open-source model execution on private silicon will become the mandatory standard, entirely replacing cloud-based APIs. Closed-source vendors will pivot to specialized, domain-specific models with proprietary datasets to retain market margins.

---

## Section 8 — Recommendations

To implement AI models safely and legally, organizations should follow a structured deployment matrix, matching task sensitivity with model licensing paradigms.

| # | Recommendation | Owner | Timeline | Success Metric | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | Conduct a legal audit of all active Llama, Gemma, and Qwen deployments to verify compliance with monthly user caps and restrictions. | Chief Legal Officer | 0 - 2 Months | Legal audit report signed and archived | High |
| R2 | Convert all downloaded model checkpoints to Safetensors format and ban the loading of raw PyTorch pickle serialization files. | DevSecOps Lead | 1 - 2 Months | Zero pickle files in active production servers | High |
| R3 | Deploy open-weight models on private, VPC-isolated infrastructure for workflows handling PII or intellectual property. | Infrastructure Architect| 3 - 6 Months | 100% of PII workflows hosted locally | High |
| R4 | Use closed-source APIs only when bound by enterprise DPAs and when model-deprecation plans are integrated into app lifecycles. | Lead Application Developer | 2 - 4 Months | Deprecation runbooks created and tested | Medium |
| R5 | Allocate R&D budget to evaluate true open-source models (like OLMo) for applications requiring complete data auditability. | R&D Director | 6 - 12 Months | Evaluation report on OLMo capability compiled | Medium |

### Rationale and Dependencies
The recommendations are sequenced to resolve legal and security risks before scaling deployment infrastructure. R1 (licensing audit) and R2 (Safetensors conversion) address immediate compliance and security vulnerabilities. Once these baselines are established, R3 (private hosting of open-weight models) and R4 (secure API usage) define the ongoing deployment architecture. Finally, R5 (evaluation of strictly open-source models) represents the long-term strategic pathway to eliminate legal risks associated with undisclosed training data.

---

## Section 9 — Knowledge Gaps & Limitations

This research is constrained by several critical information limitations. First, because Meta, Google, and Mistral do not publish the datasets used to train Llama, Gemma, and Mistral models, we cannot evaluate the actual intellectual property risk of copyright infringement. This lack of transparency means that the data provenance of open-weight models remains a significant blind spot for enterprise compliance risk assessment.

Second, the legal interpretation of "user active thresholds" (such as Meta's 700 million monthly user limit) is untested in court. It remains unclear whether this user count applies to the parent corporation's entire footprint (e.g., all Meta-using clients or a conglomerate's holdings) or only to the specific application using the model weights. To resolve these gaps, organizations must rely on custom legal counsel and monitor licensing litigation trends.

---

## Section 10 — Conclusion

In conclusion, the primary research question is answered: closed source, open source, and open weight models represent distinct paradigms with specific trade-offs in capability, licensing, security, and auditability. Closed-source models offer high reasoning performance via cloud APIs but introduce vendor dependency and data exposure risks. True open-source models offer complete transparency and auditability but lag in capability. Open-weight models represent a popular middle ground, enabling local deployment and customization, but are governed by custom community licenses that require legal tracking and compliance audits.

Technology leaders must move beyond the simplified "open versus closed" binary. Strategic model selection requires matching the legal permissions of the model license with the operational requirements of the application. By establishing a tiered deployment strategy—hosting open-weight models locally for private workflows, using closed-source APIs for complex reasoning under strict DPAs, and verifying licensing compliance—enterprises can leverage the strengths of each paradigm while protecting system integrity and minimizing legal liabilities.
